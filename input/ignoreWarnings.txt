# COPIED FROM Data Exchange For Quality Measures STU2 IG This device profile is intended to model software systems as devices, not implantable devices like what the US Core profile is describing. Approved by US Realm on 6/30/2020.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/device-softwaresystem-cqfm').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile
