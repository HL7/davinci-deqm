  "description": "[MeasureReport](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/measurereport.html) is used as an organizer for both data exchange for measure and for measure reporting. Four profiles on the MeasureReport resource are defined in this guide to delineate these different uses. The **DEQM Gaps In Care Individual MeasureReport Profile** defined here is based on the **DEQM Individual MeasureReport Profile**. It is used when a gaps in care report for a measure is reported to an aggregator for one specific patient. It contains all of the data that is relevant to generate the gaps in care report including the measure outcome and is similar to a QRDA Category 1 report. The DEQM Gaps In Care Individual MeasureReport Profile differs from a DEQM Individual MeasureReport Profile by specifying additionally that an evaluated resource can be associated with a specific population within a measure through the [DEQM Population Reference Extension](StructureDefinition-extension-populationReference.html).",
