## Operation Request Body

The request body for this operation is a [FHIR Parameters Resource](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/parameters.html). The body SHALL include a FHIR MeasureReport Resource of type `data-collection` that references a measure by canonical URL. Additionally, the FHIR Parameters resource SHALL include the URL of a Data Provider, as defined in the [Bulk Data Import Ping and Pull Approach](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/bulk-import/blob/master/import-pnp.md#bulk-data-import-kick-off-request-ping-from-data-provider-to-data-consumer). The Data Provider SHALL support `$export`. It is assumed that the data-of-interest for the measure referenced in the MeasureReport lives on the Data Provider server.

### Request Flow

The Data Consumer server SHALL support invocation of the bulk submit-data operation using the [FHIR Asynchronous Request Pattern](http://hl7.org/fhir/async.html) via a POST request containing the FHIR Parameters Resource described above. As with the [standard $submit-data operation](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/operation-measure-submit-data.html), the bulk submit-data operation will send a POST request to the `$submit-data` endpoint.

When kicking off the request, if the `“prefer”: “respond-async”` header is provided, the bulk submit-data operation will calculate the data requirements for the measure-of-interest. The Data Consumer will kick off an `$export` request to the Data Provider. Then, the data exported from the Data Provider is uploaded to the system.

Required header(s):

```
"prefer": "respond-async"
```
Specifies whether the response is immediate or asynchronous.
