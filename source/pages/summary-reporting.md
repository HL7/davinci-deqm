## Introduction

A summary report contains calculated summary data for one or more Clinical Quality Measures (CQMs) for a specified population of patients within a particular health system over a specific period of time. For example, a colorectal cancer screening CQM has patient counts for the initial population, denominator, denominator exclusions, and numerator respectively for a specified population of patients. Summary reports may also contain summary data for stratifier criteria (such as gender or age) as defined in a CQM.

The Summary reporting scenario is supported by the [DEQM Summary MeasureReport Profile]. Transactions between Reporters (for example, organizations that deliver care to patients, such as a practice or hospital) and Receivers (organizations that want to evaluate CQMs, such as quality reporting programs) are triggered by specific administrative events such as the submission of summary level quality reports for CQMs to various quality reporting programs.

## Profiles

The following resources are used in the summary reporting scenario:

|Resource Type|Profile Name|Link to Profile|

|Measure|CQFM Measure Profile|[CQFM Measure]|
|Summary MeasureReport|DEQM Summary MeasureReport Profile|[DEQM Summary MeasureReport Profile]|
|Organization|DEQM Organization Profile|[DEQM Organization]|

## Summary Measure Reporting

When the results of a quality measure are completed for a population at the end of a reporting period, they are POSTed to the quality measure Receiver's FHIR Server. The report may only consist of the Summary MeasureReport in which case it is POSTed to the MeasureReport endpoint.  If there are other referenced resources all the resources are bundled together as a set of `POST` interactions and sent as a single [transaction] interaction using the Standard FHIR API.

for a single MeasureReport:

`POST|[base]/MeasureReport`

for a Bundle Transaction:

`POST|[base]`

for an example of a Summary MeasureReport with counts for multiple populations and stratifiers  specified in an eCQM see the [Medicare Stratification Example] and the  [COL Summary MeasureReport].
