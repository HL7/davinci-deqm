### Submitting Data for Multiple Patients

#### The server processes individual Submit Data transactions as follows:

- The fullUrl refers to the `#submit-data` or `#collect-data` operation endpoint.
- The request method id `POST`
- based on the [following rules] for referencing referencing across the bundle entries if the resources are nested inside parameters and/or contained within a parameter.
   - "When resolving references, references are resolved by looking through the 'container' resource - the one that contains the other resources. Since there are no nested contained resources, there is only one container resource."
   - "References to contained resources are never resolved outside the container resource. Specifically, resolution stops at the elements Bundle.entry.resource and Parameters.parameter.resource, but not at DomainResource.contained."

For Example:
