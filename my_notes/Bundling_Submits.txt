Transaction Bundle for operations in fhir

Individual Submit Data Transaction is: POST|[base]/Measure/[measure-id]/$submit-data

So in a transaction bundle  Process any POST interactions to operation endpoint

~~~
POST|[base]

{
  "resourceType": "Bundle",
  "type": "transaction",
  "entry": [
    {
      "fullUrl": [base]/Measure/[measure-id]/$submit-data
      "resource": {
        "resourceType": "Parameters",
        "parameter": [
          {
            "name": "measurereport",
            "resource": {
              "resourceType": "MeasureReport",
              "contained": [  ( or simply listing the other named parameters)
              ...
          ]
        },
        "request": {
          "method": "POST"
            }
            ....

Rules referencing across the bundle entries if the resources are nested inside parameters and/or contained within a parameter.

(DSTU3 notes about use and interpretation of contained resources)

>When resolving references, references are resolved by looking through the 'container' resource - the one that contains the other resources. Since there are no nested contained resources, there is only one container resource.

>References to contained resources are never resolved outside the container resource. Specifically, resolution stops at the elements Bundle.entry.resource and Parameters.parameter.resource, but not at DomainResource.contained.

your examples lack a fullUrl and use PUT instead of POST and I don't know if they reference outside the scope of Parameters.parameter.resource
