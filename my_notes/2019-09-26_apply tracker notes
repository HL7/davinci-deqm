updated dependencyList

dependencyList.name,qicore|uscore|cqfm
dependencyList.location,http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore|http://hl7.org/fhir/us/core|http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/2019May
dependencyList.package,hl7.fhir.us.qicore|hl7.fhir.us.core|hl7.fhir.us.cqfmeasures
dependencyList.version,3.2.0|2.0.0|0.1.0

note that title is not being added to ig.xml by the tool

Keep the R4 stuff until the end then port over into an R4 IG
and make the change their.

"modularize the narrative pieces then"
or vice versa create a generic guide and modulularize the R4 and R3 bits

ig-pub is messing with my ig.xml file adding in packages ??

for VTE-1 tech workflow for only ind summary?


Bryn to review and mark as applied if OK:

21987  http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/datax.html#introduction
21985  where should this note go?  it does not fit in the Exchange Scenarios section of DEQM:

"Public health, as well as other stakeholders have ongoing needs for quality improvement at the point of care. Every effort should be made to establish a capable distributed rule processing environment in FHIR."

I think fits better in the Ecosystem section as a footnote.

21983
http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/guidance.html#preconditions-and-assumptions

I added smart launch since we don't talk about bulk data in this IG the disposition may be a bit premature

21982
Where does this content go - the tracker indicates in it should go here:

http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/davinci-deqm/index.html#data-model-standards-landscaper

if that is the case then should be updated in the source and not here.  let me know
